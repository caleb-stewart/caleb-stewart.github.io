                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a basic flight control system where the airplane moves based on its facing
                            direction, with control over pitch, yaw, and speed.
                        </li>

                        <li>Implemented both low-level control systems (elevator, aileron, rudder, power, and flaps)
                            for direct manipulation of aircraft components, and medium-level control systems (pitch,
                            roll, and speed) for achieving stable flight states, making the airplane simulation more
                            realistic and engaging.
                        </li>
                        <li>Demonstrated basic navigation by programming the airplane to fly between predefined
                            waypoints, where air traffic control (ATC) issues explicit and implicit commands to
                            perform complex maneuvers based on the aircraft’s current state.
